The application takes as input the stock ticker, initial deposit, the interval between deposits afterwards, the amount of the deposit, when you want to begin and when you want to finish. It works only for historical data. Can be further developedto work for crypto or other assets and generalize it to just require APY/interest instead of ticker and be able to calculate in the future.
